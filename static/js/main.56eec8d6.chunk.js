In a study of 60,756 UIs of 9,286 Android apps, we find that 7,497 UIs of 2,587 apps have at least one violation of some Material Design guidelines.

Chemotherapy-related toxicities are often predictable and, consequently, acute care visits may be preventable with adequate treatment planning and support between visits to the cancer centre. We will evaluate the impact of proactive telephone-based toxicity management on emergency department visits and hospitalizations in women with early stage breast cancer receiving chemotherapy. In this pragmatic covariate constraint-based cluster randomized trial, 20 centres in Ontario, Canada are randomly allocated to either proactive telephone toxicity management (intervention) or routine care (control). The primary outcome is the cluster-level mean number of ED\u2009+\u2009H visits per patient evaluated using Ontario administrative healthcare data. Participants are all patients with early stage (I-III) breast cancer commencing adjuvant or neo-adjuvant chemotherapy at participating institutions during the intervention period. At least 25 patients at each centre participate in a patient reported outcomes sub-study involving the collection of standardized questionnaires to measure: severity of treatment toxicities, self-care, self-efficacy, quality of life, and coordination of care. Patients participating in the patient reported outcomes (PRO) sub-study are asked to provide written consent to link their PRO data to administrative data.

The proposed strategy maximizes the expected portfolio value bounded within a targeted range, composed of a conservative lower target representing a need for capital protection and a desired upper target representing an investment goal. This strategy favorably shapes the entire probability distribution of returns, as it simultaneously seeks a desired expected return, cuts off downside risk and implicitly caps volatility and higher moments. To illustrate the effectiveness of this investment strategy, we study a multiperiod portfolio optimization problem with transaction costs and develop a two-stage regression approach that improves the classical least squares Monte Carlo (LSMC) algorithm when dealing with difficult payoffs, such as highly concave, abruptly changing or discontinuous functions. Our numerical results show substantial improvements over the classical LSMC algorithm for both the constant relative risk-aversion (CRRA) utility approach and the proposed skewed target range strategy (STRS). Our numerical results illustrate the ability of the STRS to contain the portfolio value within the targeted range.

Our proposed strategy maximizes the expected portfolio value within a target range, composed of a conservative lower target representing capital guarantee and a desired upper target representing investment goal. This strategy favorably shapes the entire probability distribution of return, as it simultaneously seeks a desired expected return, cuts off downside risk, and implicitly caps volatility, skewness and other higher moments. To illustrate the effectiveness of our investment strategy, we study a multi-period portfolio selection problem with transaction cost, and develop a decensored regression approach that improves the classical least squares Monte Carlo algorithm when dealing with truncated and discontinuous payoff functions. Our numerical tests show that the resulting distribution of portfolio wealth mimics the shape of the objective function, and that the presented strategy dominates the classical utility approach in terms of the mean-variance efficient frontier and the trade-off between return and downside risk.","yearPublished":"2017","citedBy":2,"category":{"type":"JOURNAL","categoryTitle":"arXiv preprint arXiv:1704.00416","pages":"","publisher":"","volume":"","issue":""},"teamId":"6105283db9496004d4f0b74b","__v":0,"createdAt":"2021-08-08T08:27:13.297Z","updatedAt":"2021-08-08T08:27:13.297Z","year":2017},{"_id":"610f93ad8e338e5b6446da5e","authors":["Chunyang Chen","Zhenchang Xing","Ximing Wang"],"title":"Unsupervised Software-Specific Morphological Forms Inference from Informal Discussions","link":"","description":"Informal discussions on social platforms (e.g., Stack Overflow) accumulates a large body of programming knowledge in natural language text.

Although the cause of BPD is multifactorial an inflammatory process is playing a role in the pathogenesis of BPD. Eosinophils might be part of this inflammatory process.

At each stage, each particle chooses an edge to traverse which is incident to its position. We allow the probability of choosing a given edge to depend on the sum of, the number of times that particle traversed that edge, a quantity which depends on the behaviour of the other particles, and possibly external factors. We study localization properties of this system and our main tool is a new result we establish for a very general class of urn models. More specifically, we study attraction properties of urns composed of balls with two distinct colors which evolve as follows. At each stage a ball is extracted. The probability of picking a ball of a certain color evolves in time. This evolution may depend not only on the composition of the urn but also on external factors or internal ones depending on the history of the urn. A particular example of the latter is when the reinforcement is a function of the composition of the urn and the biggest run of consecutive picks with the same color. The model that we introduce and study is very general, and we prove that under mild conditions, one of the colors in the urn is picked only finitely often.","yearPublished":"2016","citedBy":null,"category":{"type":"JOURNAL","categoryTitle":"arXiv preprint arXiv:1602.05677","pages":"","publisher":"","volume":"","issue":""},"teamId":"6105283db9496004d4f0b74b","__v":0,"createdAt":"2021-08-08T08:27:13.298Z","updatedAt":"2021-08-08T08:27:13.298Z","year":2016},{"_id":"610f95618e338e5b6446da9e","authors":["Andrea Collevecchio","Kais Hamza","Meng Shi"],"title":"Bootstrap random walks","link":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304414915300247","description":"Consider a one dimensional simple random walk X=(X n) n\u2265 0.

Our method, based on least-squares Monte Carlo simulation, has no restriction on return dynamics, portfolio constraints, intermediate consumption and investor\u2019s objective. We model return dynamics as exogenous state variables and model portfolio weights, price dynamics and portfolio value as endogenous state variables. This separation allows for incorporation of any formation of transaction cost, liquidity cost and market impact. We first perform a forward simulation for both exogenous and endogenous state variables, then use a leastsquares regression to approximate the backward recursive dynamic programs on a discrete grid of controls. Finally, we use a local interpolation and an adaptive refinement grid to enhance the optimal allocation estimates. The computational runtime of this framework grows polynomially with dimension. Its viability is illustrated on a realistic portfolio allocation example with twelve risky assets.","yearPublished":"2016","citedBy":4,"category":{"type":"JOURNAL","categoryTitle":"arXiv preprint arXiv:1610.07694","pages":"","publisher":"","volume":"","issue":""},"teamId":"6105283db9496004d4f0b74b","__v":0,"createdAt":"2021-08-08T08:27:13.298Z","updatedAt":"2021-08-08T08:27:13.298Z","year":2016},{"_id":"610f93ad8e338e5b6446da60","authors":["Guibin Chen","Chunyang Chen","Zhenchang Xing","Bowen Xu"],"title":"Learning a dual-language vector space for domain-specific cross-lingual question retrieval","link":"","description":"The lingual barrier limits the ability of millions of non-English speaking developers to make effective use of the tremendous knowledge in Stack Overflow, which is archived in English.
